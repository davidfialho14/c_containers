# C Containers
This repository contains implementations of some of the basic containers for the C programming language.
For now the collection of containers is very limited but there will be more in the future.

# Collection of containers
- list
- queue
- stack

# How to use a container in another project
There is one branch for each container implementation (e.g. the stack container is implemented in the 'stack' branch).
For now, to use a container in another project there is two options:
  - add this repository to the project and merge the container branch to another project branch
  - download the code froma specific version of the container and included in the project
Eventually this project will be compiled as shared library so that can be added to the project in a more standard way.
